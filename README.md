This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Details
Uses mysql for the database. 
This is a project I made as a school requirement. 
Originally, it's a idealized microsoft app where we have 2 key entities:
1. Trainor
2. Trainee

Trainors can create programs which Trainees can take 
Each program have a number of lessons
Each lesson have a number of sections which have lesson material
Each lesson have exams which should be passed in order for the trainee to move on to the next lesson

Once every lesson is accomplished in a program, a trainee can claim a certificate.
The purpose of this is to train aspiring miscrosoft employees on certain fields.

Microsoft can then pick from these set of trainees as their new employee.
